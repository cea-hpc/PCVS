Installing and testing IOT: MPI IO test suite
---------------------------------------------

1. unpack the archive into a directory of your choice <iotest>

2. set the environment variable IOT_HOME to the full path to <iotest>
   eg. set it in .cshrc:
     setenv IOT_HOME $HOME/iotest

3. edit <iotest>/Makevars file:
     MPIR_HOME: path to root directory of MPI installation
     MPILIB_DIRS: path to MPI library directory
     MPIINCLUDE_DIRS: path to MPI include directory
     FC: name of Fortran90 compiler

4. compile test programs
   type:
     cd <iotest>
     make
   (see Note A)

5. install executables
   type:
     make install

6. edit NQS job script
   template in bin/job
   specify location of executable program and mpirun
   change cd command to cd to data directory if necessary

7. edit user test parameter file
   parameter filename fixed in Fortran source program wrapper eg iot_all.f
   Default is data/iotparams.in, example is provided.

8. run test program
   eg. to run iot_all
     cd data
     qsub -lP <procs> job
     where <procs> is number of processors required

9. check output
   standard output and error will go to files in data directory
   test statistics output file is named in user test parameter file
   and usually goes to the timings directory.
   Example output for data/iotparams.in is provided in timings/lowlevel.out.


NOTE:

A. Makefile Targets
-------------------

In general: make, make clean, make veryclean - work on the current and
all subdirectories recursively.

Targets:

in <iotest>/src:
  all: make all executable test programs (default)
  iot_all: make executable for all test programs
  iot_lowlevel: make executable for low-level test programs
  iot_kernel: make executable for kernel test programs
  clean: remove all object files and other intermediate files
  veryclean: perform clean and remove executables from src
  
in <iotest>:
  install: copy executables to bin directory
  clean: remove all object files and other intermediate files
  veryclean: perform clean and remove executables from src and bin
  PLUS all targets for <iotest>/src
