Release Notes for the Intel Test Suite
--------------------------------------

Known problems:
A number of the arrays used for messages are declared with a numeric
size, such as info_buf[256], but are then used in contexts where, for
example, MPI_MAX_ERROR_STRING elements may be required.  In addtion, the
messages are often created with sprintf; where available, snprintf
should be used instead to ensure that the available buffer space is
not exceeded.  These usually do not cause problems when tests run
correctly, but can make it difficult to get information in the case
where a test fails.
