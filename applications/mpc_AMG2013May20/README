This package is a port of the AMG 2013 code for the Multiprocessor Computing (MPC) environment from CEA [http://paratools.fr/mpc]. 

MPC supports Intel and GNU compilers for privatization of global variables.
To use this, you must first install MPC and source the corresponding mpcvars.sh file. 
% source /opt/mpc/mpc-2.5.0/bin/mpcvars.sh (or .csh). 
If you do not have MPC, you may install the code from the above URL or download an HPC Linux OVA file from http://www.hpclinux.com. 


To build and run with the MPC Intel 14.+ compilers, you may use:
% ./build.mpc_intel.sh

To build and run with the MPC GNU 4.8+ compilers, you may use:

% ./build.mpc_gnu.sh

The output from the two cases is documented in the output.mpc_[intel,gnu].txt files in this directory. 


The original AMG2013 benchmark is available for download from:
http://www.nersc.gov/systems/trinity-nersc-8-rfp/nersc-8-trinity-benchmarks/amg/
