## TO DO ##
- Find a way to implement custom Policy from extern source
- pushing jobs results in progressive way (warnings with signal handlers !!)
- Update Filters checking (with regexs)
- Adding third way to interact with test (external data to store) maybe with dedicated socket

## DONE ##
- Set error return code according to error type, following UNIX standard (e.g errno.h)
- Check SchedByTime policy behaviour
- Support for diff webview
- HowTo + manuals
- Tests
- Interrupt master if slave is interrupted by ctrl+C (no trust in temp script)
- adding jobs time support
- Distinguish xml Output files ( in case of output path defined => all xml in same folder with same name)
- check if min < max times in configuration
- Bugfix on OpenMP detection when GCC < 4.7 (< OpenMP 3.0) because of reduction of max not implemented
- Resolve configuration option issue (--config-file matches but -c doesn't)
- Avoid to write empty XML output files if XML input files doesn't contain jobs
- Move results printing just after pushing results in file (= avoid autokill between print and push)
- Find another way to get back jobs from results file than juste compare hash names (conflict if tests with sames names in a worker)
- Warning if two tests with same name (whatever the packages) are launched in same worker
- SchedTime Policy
- Rewrite options parsing
- Adding configuration handling with configuration files
- Add options for policies switching
- Support for JsLoc
- Avoid to launch a compilation if no compilation
- Check Valgrind
- test filtering
- Check why nb Remaining jobs is -1 on some runs
- XML validation by XSD
- check OpenMP using to parse XML
- jobs times simulations
- Signal handling
- Doc
- Writing JUnit files header
